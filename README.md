# OS

Just some collection of my scripts, configs, service, etc. for my unix systems.

## Some helpful packages
- [xev](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/xorg-xev/) - Xev creates a window and then asks the X server to send it events whenever anything happens to the window
- [cava](https://github.com/karlstav/cava) - Terminal-based audio visualizer
